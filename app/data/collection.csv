- Who you sit next to matters a lot for 5-7 player games.

This is exactly how you make a 3-7 player game a 2 player game. The interactivity through the half-revealed-half-hidden-card pyramid solitaire-esque structure is exactly the mechanic to replace the renowned card drafting in the original. The added symbols for chaining also improved the ability to be strategic, opening up for more tense decision-making.

Would be a 10 but:
- The ability to play with just one other person makes this game more accessible, but at the same time, you still end up having to teach the large amount of symbology to someone who doesn't know the original.

This is an industrial revolution simulator with very strong economic mechanics, and it features the Pandemic card mechanic, but in a way more appropriate setting: route-building/investing. Cards are also interestingly just discarded to do non-location based actions, making decisions on which ones to use for the map and which ones to make the engine run exciting. 

I easily get lost in rush of taking out risky loans at the beginning to try to go for a big payoff at the end. Money is tight, until it isn't, but money doesn't matter in the end! And then victory points are easy to accumulate at the start, but you'll be digging for every last victory point at the end. 

It also ""tries"" to simulate supply and demand (probably better for 3-4 players), but the rest of the economic aspect is very tight. 

Would be 10 but:
- It's fairly easy for someone to run away with the win, at least with 2 players.","","","","54949410","8.40169","8.67297","3.906","3","32402","thing","Brass: Birmingham","2","4","120","120","60","2018","2,3,4","3,4","14+","No necessary in-game text","","","","","","standalone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

- The row of cards is a bit random/unbalanced depending on whose turn it is, and it's a really tired way to go about accumulating new abilities for your deck. I feel like there could have been a stronger tie to the exploring aspect to the map, and not just a disjoint mechanic that builds the engine that pushes you around the map.

Do not be fooled by its overtly cutesy title; this  worker placement game is a rather heavy puzzle that has you buying baby pets, raising them, showing them off at exhibitions, and then selling them to customers with extremely weird preferences. 

The core mechanic of the game is in the wonderfully difficult (and often humorous) hand management mechanic. The more animals you raise and the older they get, the more needs they have. These needs are somewhat predictable, but the more you have to draw, the more furiously you try to make sure your cages are strong/magicky enough, or that you bought enough food, or that you didn't leave the cage full of poop the one time your animal decides to come down with an illness. You always start with a little bit of a buffer, helping you plan what you need to prepare for, but that buffer very quickly shrinks as the majority of your pets' needs will be random.

Vlaada also bakes a lot of humor into the game's rules and scenarios you find yourself in (e.g. a big beast taking a large dump right before it gets sold to a customer that likes that sort of thing), making it a strangely approachable experience with a lot of depth.

This would be a 10 but:
- The needs mechanic is pure analysis paralysis. I'm not sure I have a recommended solution, and a lot of me likes that part of it, but the game isn't really sold as a hand management game since a lot of the fun is in picking unique animals to raise, magically discovering realistic personalities, and then feeling like no amount of gold or point compensation will make up for when you eventually sell them to a customer that just doesn't know them like you do.","","","","31429067","7.23462","7.46482","3.6122","220","17001","thing","Dungeon Petz","2","4","90","90","90","2011","2,3,4","4","12+","No necessary in-game text","","","","","","standalone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is a medium-weight, card-based, worker placement, VP-based game with a really interesting ""prepare for season"" mechanic that allows you to play (strategically) at a different pace than your opponents. The components are also exquisite (how do you not put the berries in your mouth...?). 

On your turn you can place one of your 2 (more in later seasons) workers to get resources/cards/points, play a card (paying for it with resources OR linking with an already played card), or bring all your people back and trigger the goodies that from from preparing for season.

Until I recently realized that you can play from your hand OR THE MEADOW, I thought this game was luck-based trash. But being able to play a card from a community area ramps up the interactivity and allows for you to more easily link cards to play combos to really take advantage of the many syntheses built into the cards.

This would be a 10, but:
- It's still a little-luck based. Crushing combos can be dealt to someone's hand with no opportunity for retribution in the meadow. I think playing with fewer of the duplicate cards as a part of setup for a 2 player game, for example, would help clean up the fact that you don't need 5 (or whatever) farms in that game.","","","","66368044","7.85326","8.1044","2.8041","29","35138","thing","Everdell","1","4","80","80","40","2018","1,2,3,4","3","10+","Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","","","","","","standalone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I freaking love this game. The setup takes forever, and teaching each of the 1 million actions to someone who doesn't know who Uwe Rosenburg is (all my friends...) makes this very unappealing to pull out. BUT, there are so many valid paths to victory, it changes every time you start with different cards which give you key advantages you need to incorporate to win, the theme is incredibly strong despite being a boastful Euro, and the solo variant (as expected from Uwe) is good enough for me to campaign by myself over a dry period in game nights.","","","","38051230","7.93602","8.19776","3.8421","21","24084","thing","A Feast for Odin","1","4","120","120","30","2016","1,2,3,4","3","12+","Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","","","","","","standalone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Would be a 10 but:

I have dreams about playing this game. People who play this with me have dreams about playing this game. The org chart mechanic  is SO GOOD. You have this puzzle-solving desire to plan way ahead, writing down the 27 steps you're going to take over the next 3 turns, only for an opponent to place a new restaurant or marketing campaign in a place you didn't consider. Now you need a new sheet of paper and another 30 minutes to figure out a completely different strategy. 

The other major appeal to this is the fact that it's almost entirely open information and there is NO RANDOMNESS after setup. You are in complete control of  having sold one lemonade for $10 the same turn someone else just sold 35 slices of pizza for $18 bucks a slice.

Its inevitable propensity for there to be a runaway leader actually doesn't hurt the game since it makes the game end the faster someone is winning. It's also very thematically appropriate. You didn't expect to get out-priced by having one-too-few Waitresses to break the demand tie, and suddenly instead of being able to fund your large class of employees that you just trained, you instead will have to let them all go. That's the restaurant business, baby! 

The ridiculously overpowered milestones are also a crucial part of the game (also very thematic). Being the first to something gives you an incredibly big head-start, but it also forces you into a strategy you might not be comfortable with, depending on what your competitors are doing.","","","","51902154","7.83947","8.12707","4.1909","31","16890","thing","Food Chain Magnate","2","5","240","240","120","2015","2,3,4,5","3,4","14+","Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","","","","","","standalone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"Galaxy Trucker","31481","9","","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","3","","The epitome of a good puzzle tile game. In Galaxy Trucker, you play each round in two phases. 

First phase is a race to flip over various ship components and try to find ones that can fit with varying success onto your board. you do this simultaneously with your opponents, so the quicker you make decisions and finish your ship, the further ahead you'll start in round 2. However, the perfectionist in you will also try to build the ""best"" ship to weather whatever random events that occur in round two. The challenge is quickly finding the ""perfect piece"" that fits and also helps round out your ship's build. Will you end up with no guns and 45 engines? Will you end up with an indestructible ship and only room for 2 goods to take back? Will you be very easily wiped out by a pandemic?

Second phase has you drawing event cards, many bad events that usually hit the player in the front first and trickle back until someone can stop it, and a few good events that provide the early birds with the opportunity to salvage higher value goods, ultimately scoring them more points, if their ship can make it to the end.

You play over three (four?) rounds, each round increasing the size of the ship and the length of phase 2.

This would be a 10 but:
- Rounds 1 and 2 don't matter because the points earned are insignificant. Don't play them unless someone is learning. I would play 2-3 rounds of round 3, deciding as a group which side to use.","","","","39184264","7.27973","7.4004","2.3253","198","33390","thing","Galaxy Trucker","2","4","60","60","60","2007","2,3,4","4","10+","Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","","","","","","standalone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is my favorite area control game. There are four equally important reasons this sits high on my list:
- The extremely balanced and crisp action drafting mechanic (and non-committal drafting where you could ditch a card you held onto earlier in the draft to stick to your opponent, which is crucial)
- Low numbers, no-dice area control, but without dice. The only variability is your friends' diplomacy, or else your opponents' hand of ""gotcha""-esque red cards that are about to become your nightmare like a call back to MTG or Yugioh.
- The art.
- The multiple victory conditions you always have to be wary of, and the unique victory declaration mechanic.

It really scratches the itch of LCGs of spending money on packs to try to get cool cards, and then using those cards to play the game itself. When I do play this, I enjoy the absolute crap out of it, but I rarely am able to play this. I love the idea of this game, and want it to be more than it is.

This would be a 9/10 but:
- The setup takes eons, and the simulated LCG is a little bland (though that probably helps a lot with keeping the complexity down, and it's also difficult to invent a new LCG on top of having invented this game). 
- The theme doesn't really resonate with many of the people I play games with, so they don't have that same LCG itch to scratch.

I love this game. It's the original Quacks of Quedlinburg, but with more than just a pot of hope turned despair at the pull of a premature white token (1/15 chance of pulling a 3? Are you kidding me!?). Also, there's not really a profound push-your-luck component. It's a classic pool builder with various tracks. It's one of those great engine builders that leaves you saying ""it's almost the end, and I haven't even done a quarter of what I wanted to do"" that tugs you back into another game.

Would be a 10:
- Weakish theme, but it's a Euro.
- The Events become mathy because you know there are 3 of each and can plan ahead, which to counter the theme. I wish this was a dice roll. I openly welcome the game with 6 plagues!
- Since it's a pool builder with a bag, it's still very possible to get screwed and never pull the piece(s) you need, so the most efficient pool builder, like in quacks, may not win because of bad luck, though there are some clever less-than-efficient ways to mitigate this. It's still subpar to a deck builder where you always make it through every card you just bought before starting with the improved version of the deck.

This is an economic engine game disguised as a tetris game that you can play with another person. It's completely open-information and there is no randomness after setup, but it doesn't play like chess because it doesn't feel like chess. It's such a casual theme, and the amount of options you have is countable on one hand.

In theory, you could use backward induction and an exorbitantly complicated execution of game theory to completely solve the puzzle, but it would probably take a computer. Like chess, it's incredibly enticing to play this because there's only one other variable (the singular opponent) and more poorly executing strategy than your opponent leads directly to a well-deserved loss. You see this in action some handful of steps before the end, where both players are thinking 3-5 turns ahead to determine which pieces to play to guarantee a win, and good players can usually shake on a checkmate without having to go through the motions. There is a satisfaction in jointly agreeing early on the objective end without simulation.

This would be a 10 but:
- There's not nearly enough Tetris. Most of your points come from targeting tiles that have a lot of income on them. One person does get 7 points for a 7x7, and while the points can make a difference, that singular prize doesn't feel good satisfying enough for fitting your pieces very efficiently and using leather pieces in smart ways. It's almost like there need to be other prizes. Now the cost of going only for income tiles is the cost in buttons, time, and sometimes convenient placement, but I've rarely seen a high-income strategy fail because of any of those costs.","","","","38051560","7.5439","7.64978","1.6254","93","72065","thing","Patchwork","2","2","30","30","15","2014","2","2","6+","No necessary in-game text","","","","","","standalone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This game features both a complex oil-based economy simulator with all the vertical stages of production to commercialization from buying oil in a fluctuating market, to refining the oil through your carefully crafted maze of long pipes, to storage with tanks you have to buy, to commercialization with contracts that you can't miss. 

Mechanically, you place your worker on only a handful of spaces to do something at one of the points of production, including buying pipe tiles to try to fit strategically in your tableau of other pipe tiles. You can instead place a worker on your tiles of pipes, activating the pipes your worker touches to refine oil. Additionally, there is also some level of action efficiency that you're trying to achieve by picking the order of actions you do, but many other forces, including your opponents, may inhibit that optimization.

This is exactly what push your luck should look like. It's a pool-building game where you pull pieces from your bag, placing them on your board trying to go as far around the pot without busting to score points and buy new pieces that will help you go further around the pot the next time around. The pieces you can buy come with really cool mechanics, and there are 4 different mechanic sets to play with. With the Geekbit acrylic pieces, you cannot help but clank your bag full of the potential for a runaway victory or early bust with nothing to show for it. I also really enjoy that the random cards are always helpful, typically for someone who might be falling behind.

This would be a 10 but:
- There are 1/15 chance games that ruin you halfway through, and there are even higher probability games where you just pull a bunch of white tokens to start, with only an expensive potion to put one back (often to only draw it back again!). This can really stunt your ability to go far around the pot because both points and ability to buy better tokens are tied to how far you go. If you bust, you have to choose either points or money for tokens, but having only one essentially hinders all the remaining turns no matter which one you choose. I think a cool solution to this would be for the cost of busting to give up rubies (instead of paying rubies for the potion that sometimes doesn't actually help). That way, riskier players can spend the rubies on the small advantages, while more conservative players can build a reserve. However, the core mechanic of the game would remain in tact, and there would be tighter races for the finish.","","","","66368055","7.65124","7.8335","1.9497","66","37733","thing","The Quacks of Quedlinburg","2","4","45","45","45","2018","2,3,4","4","8+","Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","","","","","","standalone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It still has the same shared action selection mechanic, but cards are multi-use. They are the economy, discarding any X cards to pay for a building that costs X cards; they are the buildings themselves; and they are the goods that you play on various plantations. The fun choice in the game is which expensive card you're going to play and which one(s) you're going to have to toss to help pay for it.

This would be a 9/10 but:
- There aren't very many winning strategies, particularly ones involving indigo plants--those just end up being cards used as money.
- The building variety is limited, even though there are a ton of cards.

"Suburbia","123260","9","","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","","### GAME I WILL ALWAYS PLAY ###

This game is a city-builder with hex tiles that depend heavily on tile placement, which are purchased on a market track that decreases the cost as the tile sits in the market longer. Suburbia also features a super interesting balancing mechanic for players who focus too much on increasing their city's income or population without balancing the other. The goal is to have the highest population, but as you grow, you cross over red bars on the scoring track that send BOTH your income (money per turn) and reputation (population per turn) back by one step, so if you grow too quickly, your next turns may give you no money or make you PAY money (very thematically appropriate)! Worse, these red lines get closer and closer together the higher you are on the track, keeping players from running away with a victory. On the other hand, if you focus only on making money, you will not be able to push your population up, which is the only number that matters at the end of the game.

Suburbia also has fairly significant hidden personal goals that usually award a very large amount of points if you successfully achieve your goal. This helps steer players to slightly different strategies despite having equal starting boards and the same market to choose tiles from.

This would be a 10 but:
- The hidden personal goals are too influential on the final score and kind of wreck the beautiful balancing mechanic on the score track that naturally makes games fairly close. I don't know if making them personal but unhidden would detract from the fun of the game.","","","","31428689","7.3609","7.51398","2.7704","156","25152","thing","Suburbia","1","4","90","90","60","2012","1,2,3,4","3","10+","Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","","","","","","standalone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"Terraforming Mars","167791","9","","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","","### GAME I WILL ALWAYS PLAY ###

Terraforming Mars is an excellent, asymetric power, card-driven board game with a minor but crucial interactive component of collectively raising the temperature, Oxygen level, and number of ocean tiles. Critically, after each have reached a certain amount, the game then ends. Notably, there is some selfish gain to terraforming as it increases your ""TP"", which not only counts toward a large portion of your final score, but it also acts as a base income level for each generation. 

Points are also achievable from Cards or card combos. In fact, most of the actions you play come from paying money to play cards that you drafted and then paid a small fee to include in your hand. These can directly terraform Mars, earning you a chunk of TP, but you can also build cities to get income or have various things like pets, microbes, tardigrades, inventions, loans, indentured workers (yikes), or other very thematic cards that do interesting things. These cards are also in large quantity and unique, making each new game very interesting.

You can also directly terraform Mars for a relatively high price, and your personal engine can also allow you to terraform for free, if you've built it up to do that. 

Lastly, you can claim a milestone from a limited selection, which you reach and alone hold points for, or can fund an award from a limited selection, which is a gamble as the winner of the award isn't determined until the end.

Would be 10 but:
- Solo variant eliminates the usefulness of VP-Based strategies (though I do really like the concept of non-VP victory conditions).
